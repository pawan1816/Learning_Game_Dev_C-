🔥 In Vim, here’s how you actually Copy and Paste:
1. Copy inside vim:
Go to normal mode (Press Esc key first)

Select text:

Press v to start visual mode.

Move cursor (←, →, ↑, ↓) to select text.

After selecting:

Press y → (stands for "yank" = copy)

✅ Now the text is copied inside vim.

2. Paste inside vim:
Go to the place where you want to paste.

Press p → (stands for "put" = paste after cursor)

✅ Your copied text will be pasted.

🔥 Simple Vim Commands Summary:

Action	Vim Command
Copy (Yank) line	yy
Copy (Yank) selection	v → move → y
Paste after cursor	p
Paste before cursor	P
⚡ Bonus (Copy-Paste between system clipboard and vim):
If you want to copy from vim to your Windows clipboard (outside vim),
you need to use "+y instead of y:

Select text (v and move arrows)

Press "+y to copy to Windows clipboard.

✅ Then you can paste outside vim (like into Notepad).

Similarly, to paste system clipboard into vim:

In normal mode, type: "+p

📢 Important:
"+y and "+p work only if vim supports clipboard (+clipboard feature).

In Windows Terminal + WSL, you usually need vim-gtk or neovim for full clipboard support.

🎯 In simple words for you:

Goal	How to do it
Copy inside vim	v → move → y
Paste inside vim	p
Copy from vim to Windows clipboard	v → move → "+y
Paste from Windows clipboard into vim	"+p
